Dynamic DNS using the DreamHost API

To use the DreamHost DNS API to manage DDNS:
  1. Check out this repository somewhere publicly accessible and
     update index.cgi with the path to a Racket executable:
	 #!/path/to/racket
  2. Get an API key for 'All DNS functions' from DreamHost:
     https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.api
	 and copy the key to ~/.ddns.api-key at DreamHost.
  3. Create a .htpasswd file for the dynamic host:
     htpasswd -c ~/.ddns.htpasswd home.example.com
  4. Update the .htaccess file in this directory to reference
     the AuthUserFile in the home directory:
	 AuthUserFile /home/myusername/.ddns.htpasswd
  5. On the dynamic host, create a cron job to call the script:
     # Every three hours: midnight, 8am, 4pm
     0 0,8,16 * * * curl --basic --user <host>:<passwd> \
	   https://home.example.com/ddns/ >/var/log/ddns.log
	 
The password is sent in the clear so ensure TLS. The DNS TTL is
up to 4 hours so there is no point setting a cron interval less
than this.
